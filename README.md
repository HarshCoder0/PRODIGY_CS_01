This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a basic substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed amount.

Decrypts encrypted text by reversing the shift.

Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Ignores non-alphabetic characters (keeps them unchanged).

🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x

📜 Example Usage

Enter the message: HELLO
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted: KHOOR
Decrypted: HELLO
